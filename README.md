WalkForwardAnalysis
===================

This sheet processes the bucket files that are combined or broken out via the Process Buckets
repository.   It opens each optimisation file and then deletes and sorts the data based upon
the input criteria.   The EA inputs are then selected and the appropriate walk forward file is
opened to get the result for that set of optimisation criteria.
